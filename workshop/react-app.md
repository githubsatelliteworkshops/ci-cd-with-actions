## React app

This repository contains source for a new single page application which has been created using a React starter npx command.
Please find the details about the same in [Create a new react app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)

- This repo contains ready to use starter code in src/ and a prebuilt package.json
- It contains only a frontend build pipeline and no databases or backend
- The command `npm run build` creates an optimized build of your app in the `build` folder.
- The `build` folder contains the static pages which can be deployed to a service of your choice luke Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.
- For our workshop to simplify the setup required for the hosting services, we will be using GitHub Pages.

Following is the starter app built using this repository -
